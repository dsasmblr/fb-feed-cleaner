# Facebook Feed Cleaner

This is a [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) script that gets rid of "Suggested" and "Sponsored" posts from your FB feed.

Simply copy and paste the script code into a new Tampermonkey script, save it, refresh FB and voila.

One side effect of this change is you'll notice posts take more time to load as you scroll. That's because Facebook is loading a crap-ton of suggested and sponsored posts, which this script removes, and then more posts are fetched from FB, and, finally, you'll end up with posts loaded from the people and groups you're connected with.
